        About Me
        </h1>
        <p>I am a Digital Marketer / Consultant / Youtuber / LinkedIn Content Creator and a lot more
      I am an executioner and a hardcore practitioner of the concepts that I suggest my clients to follow.
       I have a wide knowledge of various niches, that helps me develop a customised and super specific strategy for any kind of business. 
        My main objective is to squeeze the revenue from the most apparent and non apparent platforms, 
        resulting in the bottom line you might have only imagined.</p>
